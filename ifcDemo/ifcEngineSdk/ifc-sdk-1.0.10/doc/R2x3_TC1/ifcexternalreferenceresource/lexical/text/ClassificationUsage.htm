	 <H3>Classification Usage</H3> 
	 <H4>Classification Notation</H4> 
	 <P>The principal applied is that any type of object can be classified. No
		distinction is made between a product, a process, a control or a resource. The
		means by which an object may be classified is the IfcClassificationNotation
		class.</P> 
	 <H4>Relating Classifications to Objects</H4> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> class forms part of the
		<I>IfcKernel</I> schema. It is used to apply an
		<I>IfcClassificationNotation</I> to an object through its relation to
		<I>IfcObject</I> or <I>IfcPropertyDefinition</I> (from which all objects that
		can be classified are subtyped). Each instance of
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> enables the association of one
		classification notation with one or many objects.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG
		SRC="../figures/IfcExternalReferenceResource-Fig01.gif" ALT="RelClassifies"
		WIDTH="551" HEIGHT="211" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P>It is possible for an object to have multiple classifications. This is
		achieved through the use of multiple instances of
		<I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I>, each instance pointing to a particular
		classification notation and to the objects that are classified by this
		notation.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG
		SRC="../figures/IfcExternalReferenceResource-Fig02.gif"
		ALT="RelClassifiesExample" WIDTH="607" HEIGHT="267" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P>Using the <I>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</I> relationship class means
		that any object that is not classified does not have to carry empty attributes
		for classification (as was the case with previous versions of the IFC
		model).</P> 
	 <H4>Facets of a Classification Notation</H4> 
	 <TABLE WIDTH="100%">

		  <TD WIDTH="275"><IMG

		  <TD> 
			 <P>Many modern classification systems (such as Uniclass, BSAB etc.)
				allow for multi-faceted classification. This is reflected in the IFC
				Classification Model through provision of the
				<I>IfcClassificationNotationFacet</I> class where each instance represents one
				facet of a classification notation. The classification notation itself is then
				made up of a list of notation facets. </P> 
			 <P>The list is declared to be a unique list to ensure both that there
				is order in the specification of the notation facets and to ensure that a facet
				can only be included once in each list.</P> 
			 <P>For instance, considering a fan in an HVAC ductline. As a
				construction product, it has the Uniclass notation facet L7533. However, if we
				consider a work section view with the fan as part of the low velocity air
				conditioning system, the notation facet is JU30. Therefore, there are two
				facets in the classification notation which becomes ('JU30', 'L7533')</P></TD>

	 <H3>The Classification Hierarchy</H3> 
	 <TABLE WIDTH="100%"> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD WIDTH="275" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG
			 SRC="../figures/IfcExternalReferenceResource-Fig04.gif"
			 ALT="classification relationship" WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0"></TD> 
		  <TD> 
			 <P>Classification systems are generally declared in a hierarchical
				structure in which a facet at an upper level in the hierarchy (parent level) is
				a generalization of the facets at the next lower level in the hierarchy (child
				level). The hierarchy of the classification system is defined in tables (ref.
				CI/SfB) or sections (ref. CAWS) or some other named, coherent approach.
				Typically, the position in the hierarchy is identified by a nomenclature or
				label e.g. X12, and the identity at the child level is derived by adding
				(concatenating) characters e.g. X121, X122, X123 etc.</P> 
			 <P>Within the IFC Classification Model, the ability to identify
				location in a classification hierarchy is termed the
				<I>IfcClassificationItem</I> (so as not to be identified as table, section etc.
				but as a generalisation of these terms).</P></TD>

		ALT="Classification Structure Example" WIDTH="683" HEIGHT="324" BORDER="0"></P>
	 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The whole of the classification hierarchy can now be
		exposed through the IFC Classification Model. This is achieved by providing a
		recursive relationship on the <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> class. Therefore, an
		instance of <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> can contain a unique list (to ensure
		order and uniqueness of list members) of other instances of
		<I>IfcClassificationItem</I>. The requirement of this relationship is that a
		list cannot contain the same instance of <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> as is
		acting as the container or any instance of <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> that
		has already been declared as a member of any other list in the hierarchy i.e.
		an <I>IfcClassificationItem</I> can appear only once in a hierarchy.</P> 
	 <H4>The Classification System</H4> 
	 <P>Each classification item belongs to an <I>IfcClassification</I>. This
		provides the means to identify the classification system being used.
		<I>IfcClassification</I> has attributes which define its source, edition and
		name. </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Name identifies what would usually be considered to be the name of
		  the classification system such as CI/SfB, BSAB, CAWS, Masterformat, Uniformat
		  etc.</LI> 
		<LI>Edition provides a version identification.</LI> 
		<LI>Edition Date identifies the date at which the edition became
		  operational.</LI> 
		<LI>Source identifies the publishing reference of the classification
		  system (e.g. for Uniclass, the source would be RIBA)</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H4>Referencing External Classifications</H4> 
	 <P>Recognizing that it may not be appropriate to maintain the whole detail
		of classification within the object model, and taking the view that information
		may well be referenced from external sources by its address to enable access
		through mechanisms such as the World Wide Web, the IFC Classification Model
		includes a means to reference a classification through the
		<I>IfcClassificationReference</I> class. This is a type of IfcExternalReference
		that has a label (which can be the reference address) and identifier.
		Additional information may be available concerning the classification system
		source that is being referenced.</P> 
	 <H4>Relation Between Classification Notations</H4> 
	 <P>Whilst several different classification notations may be applied to an
		object, <B>there is no equivalence between the classification notations</B>.
		<B>Therefore, the IFC Classification Model cannot be used to translate from one
		classification notation to another</B>. The reason for this is that, generally,
		it is possible to select from any of several different notations within a
		classification system for an object. The actual selection is the responsibility
		of the user according to circumstances. Therefore, there is a many to many
		relationship between classification systems for which there is no resolution at
		this stage of development.</P> </BODY>
