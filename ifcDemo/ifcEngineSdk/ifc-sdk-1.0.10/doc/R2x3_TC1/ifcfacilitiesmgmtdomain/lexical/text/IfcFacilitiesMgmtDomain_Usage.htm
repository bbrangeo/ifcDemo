<h2>Facilities Management Usage </h2>
 
	 
<h3>Move Management </h3>
 
	 
<p>The objective of move management is to move actors (defined as people,
		groups of people identified as some sub-structure of an organization such as a
		department or a division or whole organizations) together with all of their
		associated equipment and furnishings from one place to another.</p>
 
	 
<p>The main class for move management in the IFC Model is IfcMove. Each
		move is identified by a name (e.g. Move Executive Vice President John Smith)
		which is simply a label expressed as a text string. The IfcMove class also has
		attributes that enable identification of fromwhere a move is to be made and to
		where it is to be made. The data type for the 'MoveFrom' and 'MoveTo' attribute
		is IfcSpatialStructureElement which enables identification of the source or
		target of the move as being a site, building, building storey or individual
		space.</p>
 
	  
	 
<p>Identification of the things that need to be moved is achieved through
		the IfcRelAssignsToProcess. This allows selection of the actor(s) (through
		selection of IfcActor), equipment (through selection of IfcEquipmentElement)
		and furniture (through selection of IfcFurnishingElement) that are to be moved.
		Identification of whether the actor to be moved is a person, group of people or
		an entire organization is achieved using the IfcPerson,
		IfcOrganizationRelationship and IfcOrganization classes within the
		IfcActorResource schema.</p>
 
	 
<p>Various constraints can be applied to the move. These can be defined
		both qualitatively (e.g. as soon as possible, move out by etc.) and
		quantitatively in terms of date and time. Several qualitative constraints can
		be applied and these can operate in conjunction with the date and time to
		provide details about move arrangements. </p>
 
	 
<p>Provision is made for a punch list (or defects list) to be defined for
		each move. This allows for the completion of a move to be agreed. </p>
 
	 
<p>Moves can also be aggregated together into move groups where the group
		can be used to handle a number of individual moves as a single unit.</p>
 
	 
<p>Planning for a move may be undertaken through the development of a work
		schedule (see IfcProcessExtension schema). In the case of a move, the elements
		of a work schedule are defined as IfcMoveScheduleElements (which is a subtype
		of IfcWorkScheduleElement and therefore inherits all the basic attributes of an
		element in a schedule). </p>
 
	 
<h3>FM Standards Assignment </h3>
 
	 
<p>In Facilities Management, it is common practice to determine the quality
		of provided space, furniture and equipment according to the function of the
		role or job that a person is fulfilling. Note that it is considered to be the
		function rather than the person or title of the job that drives the standard.
		</p>
 
	 
<p>An assignment is made between a particular standard (IfcSpaceProgram,
		IfcFurnitureStandard, IfcEquipmentStandard) and the persons to whom the
		standard applies through the use of a relationship class
		(IfcRelAssignsFMStandard). This assignment effectively says that 'these persons
		are assigned this particular standard of space, equipment or furniture by
		virtue of their job function. The job function is an attribute of the
		relationship class and is used as the constraining mechanism for the standard
		rather than the identity of the person or their job title because, for
		instance, it may be the policy of the organization to assign a higher standard
		of furniture to someone in a marketing role (which is customer facing) than to
		the technical director.</p>
 
	 
<p>Each standard is determined by one or more classification notations. For
		instance, several different classifications of furniture may be encompassed by
		a single furniture standard according to the different types of furniture that
		may be applied. The FM standards do not relate to individual objects since this
		would mean that the standard needed to know about instances of e.g. furniture
		that are in use. By using the reference to a classification, quality criteria
		can be established. Since each instance of furniture may itself have a
		classification, the ability of that instance to participate in a particular
		standard is established.</p>
 
	 
<h3>Maintenance Work Order Assignment To Assets </h3>
 
	 
<p>A maintenance work order is defined as a type of work order with
		additional attributes that characterize its use in a maintenance environment.
		It defines the maintenance actions that are to be carried out. It does not
		identify the assets on which the work is carried out; this is achieved through
		the IfcRelMaintenanceEvent class which relates a maintenance work order to one
		or many assets.An event defines the occurrence, or required occurrence of the
		maintenance action. </p>
 
	  
	 
<h3>Recording Maintenance History (Events) </h3>
 
	 
<p>A maintenance record (IfcMaintenanceRecord) provides a listing of all
		maintenance events that have taken place. It relies on the information stored
		within the instantiation of the assets and maintenance work orders for
		particular details of what happened at the event. All maintenance events are
		stored in the maintenance record in order and without redundancy. </p>
