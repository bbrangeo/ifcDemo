	 <H2>Process Usage</H2> 
	 <H3>Work Control</H3> 
	 <P>In the IFC model, both work plans and work schedules are considered to
		be subtypes of an entity named <I>IfcWorkControl</I>. This supertype acts to
		capture the common attributes of work plans and schedules. It is an abstract
		entity; only the subtypes are instantiated.</P> 
	 <H4>Work Plan</H4> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcWorkPlan</I> provides an overall container for all the work
		schedules and the resources identified as being brequired to carry out the work
		tasks.</P> 
	 <H4>Work Schedule</H4> 
	 <P>An <I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> is used to represent information that is
		contained with any schedule (or programme) of work. At the highest level it
		captures the essential information concerning the schedule including name,
		description and purpose; who created it and when together with identification
		of the overall start, end and float time for the complete set of work described
		by the schedule.</P> 
	 <P>In the example shown below, all of the information shown forms part of
		the <I>IfcWorkSchedule</I> class. The header information is captured as direct
		attributes with the title being 'Process Extension Example'. The table is
		captured as a set of <I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I> relationships (see below).</P>

	 <P>It is possible to exchange information about complex work schedules in
		which the work is broken down into a series of schedules, each schedule
		exposing a particular aspect of the work. This is done using a nesting
		capability in which a schedule is nested within a higher level schedule.</P>

	 <H3>Elements of a Work Control (Plan or Schedule)</H3> 
	 <P>The elements of a work control represent the individual items of
		interest. Typically, they are the 'lines' that appear on a Gantt chart. For
		instance, each identified line in the example shown above (1,2,3 etc.)
		represents an element of a work schedule.</P> 
	 <P>Each element consists of two parts namely a task (<I>IfcTask</I>) and
		the schedule time for that task (<I>IfcScheduleTimeControl</I>). Tasks are
		assigned to a work schedule through the relationship class
		<I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I>. <I>IfcRelAssignsTasks</I> collects together all of
		the information that appears on a line within a schedule including the task and
		the schedule time control. Practically, it relates one task to one schedule
		time control.</P> 
	 <P>Tasks can be nested so that the schedule can be decomposed. This is
		shown in the example by the various indentation levels of the main task, major
		sub-task and individual task levels.</P> 
	 <P>A task can be identified specifically as a milestone.</P> 
	 <H3> Tasks and Scheduling</H3> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcTask</I> class provides for the action to be undertaken to be
		annotated (both in short form by using the work task name attribute and in long
		form by providing the work task with a description). It can also be identified
		using a series of codes that are identified as Work Breakdown Structure or WBS
		Codes. </P> 
	 <P>Task information is shown under 'Task Name' in the example above (which
		does not show the full range of information that can be identified in
		tasks).</P> 
	 <P>Note that sequencing constraints between tasks are enabled through the
		<I>IfcRelSequence</I> class which is exposed in the <I>IfcKernel</I> schema and
		directly sequences processes. This capability is applied to <I>IfcTask</I>
		which is a subtype of <I>IfcProcess</I>.</P> 
	 <P>The <I>IfcScheduleTimeControl</I> class captures the timing that can be
		applied to a task. In the IFC model, it is identified by an extensive series of
		attributes; in a printed version of a schedule, it would be shown textually, or
		by a bar on the Gantt chart or by a box in a Network diagram.</P> 
	 <H3>Relating Resources</H3> 
	 <P>Resources are considered to be those things that can be used to assist
		in the completion of a project. Various types of resource are defined in the
		<I>IfcConstructionMgmtDomain</I> schema including labor, material,
		sub-contract, equipment and others.</P> 
	 <P>Resources used are identified directy within the work plan and work
		schedule.</P> 
	 <P>For tasks, resources are allocated through the relationship cass
		<I>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</I>.</P> </BODY>
