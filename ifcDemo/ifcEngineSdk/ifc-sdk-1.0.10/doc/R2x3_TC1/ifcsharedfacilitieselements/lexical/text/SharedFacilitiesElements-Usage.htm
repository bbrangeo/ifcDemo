<h2>Shared Facilities Elements Usage </h2>

<h3>Furniture and System Furniture</h3>

<p>In the IfcProductExtension schema, the IfcElement class is
decomposed into a number of subtypes. One of these is the
IfcFurnishingElement from which are developed the IfcFurniture and
IfcSystemFurnitureElement classes.</p>

<p>A furniture object (instance of the IfcFurniture class) is
considered to be a discrete item of furniture in its own right (table,
chair, etc.). A system furniture element object (instance of the
IfcSystemFurnitureElement class) is an identifiable item (modesty
panel, side, desktop etc.) that participates in the assembly of a
discrete item of furniture.</p>

<p>Each IfcFurniture object and each IfcSystemFurnitureElement
object is of a particular type. It may be a chair, desk, table etc for
discrete furniture or modesty panel, side panel, desktop etc. for
system furniture. Specification of the type is left to the user of the
application providing the information. For applications however, there
are a number of predefined property sets for types of furniture that
can be assigned to furniture objects. Other property sets may be
defined as necessary.</p>

<h3>Asset Identification</h3>

<p>An IfcAsset allows for the grouping of objects to form a unit
that has an identifiable financial value and/or upon which specific
facilities management operations take place.</p>

<p>Each asset carries a unique identifier, cost,ownership,
location and other information that is required.</p>

<h3>Inventory</h3>

<p>An IfcInventory provides a list of objects of a particular
type, the type of objects that are contained being identified by the
IfcInventoryEnum. This identifies that either assets, furniture or
spaces are recorded within the inventory. The actual objects that are
included are determined by the IfcInventorySelect type which is driven
by the enumerated value selection.</p>

<p>Each inventory has one or more responsible persons and an
organizational jurisdiction (which is valuable in facilities management
situations where more than one functional group or organization is
concerned).</p>
